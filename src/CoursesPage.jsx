      "AI Generalist OS is a 38-day live, cohort-based program that takes you from scattered AI exposure to demonstrable capability.\n\nMost people stuck on AI are stuck at the same place: enough exposure to feel behind, not enough structure to build anything. Tool demos create activity — they do not create capability. This program is built around the opposite idea: every phase ends with an artifact you keep.\n\nThe program deliberately occupies the practical middle ground. It is simple enough to enter without a coding background, and deep enough that you finish having built and published six working AI systems.\n\nTheory is taught by an AI research scientist and founder; implementation is led by a CTO. Both are present for all 38 days — you are not handed to a teaching assistant once the build sprint starts.",
